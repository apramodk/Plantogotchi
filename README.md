# Plant Tamagotchi

This project utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller along with a TFT LCD Display Module GC9A01 Driver, an Analog Soil Moisture Sensor, and a Photoresistor to create a digital pet for your plant, akin to a Tamagotchi. The device monitors the soil moisture level and light exposure to simulate the plant's health and happiness.

## Components Used

- ESP32 microcontroller
- TFT LCD Display Module GC9A01 Driver
- Analog Soil Moisture Sensor
- Photoresistor

## Installation

1. Connect the ESP32 board to the TFT LCD Display Module, Soil Moisture Sensor, and Photoresistor following the pin connections specified in the code.

2. Upload the provided Arduino code to the ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE or any other compatible IDE.

3. Ensure that the required libraries are installed in your Arduino environment:
   - PNG decoder library
   - SPI.h
   - TFT_eSPI.h

4. After uploading the code, power up the device, and you should see the plant Tamagotchi interface displayed on the TFT LCD screen.

## Usage

The device monitors two crucial aspects for the plant's well-being: soil moisture level and light exposure.

- **Soil Moisture Level**: The analog soil moisture sensor measures the moisture level in the soil. When the soil becomes too dry, the device prompts the user to water the plant.

- **Light Exposure**: The photoresistor measures the intensity of light. Plants require a certain amount of sunlight to thrive. The device keeps track of the duration of sunlight exposure. If the plant receives insufficient sunlight, its happiness level decreases.

The device simulates a day-night cycle, with each simulated day lasting approximately 24 hours. Throughout the day, the plant's happiness level is updated based on its care and the environmental conditions.

## Functionality

- **Plant Happiness**: The device displays a digital representation of the plant's mood (either happy or sad) based on its care and environmental conditions.

- **User Interaction**: Users can interact with the device by watering the plant when prompted and ensuring it receives adequate sunlight.
